{"heading": "Gout: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment", "contents": "Also called \"gouty arthritis,\" gout is a painful form of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body.\n\nThe painful flare-ups may be concentrated in the big toe (a symptom known as podagra), as well as swelling and pain in the ankles, knees, feet, wrists or elbows. Flare-ups last days in the beginning, but can become progressively longer. Left untreated, gout can cause permanent damage to joints and kidneys, according to theNational Institutes of Health(NIH).\n\nGout is most commonly seen in men, particularly those between the ages of 40 and 50. It is a very common disease. Six million adults age 20 and olderhave reported being diagnosed with gout according to theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases(NIAMS).\n\n\"Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. It is caused by an elevation of serum uric acid levels that cause crystals to accumulate in the joints, which bring on a gout flare,\" Dr. N. Lawrence Edwards, professor of medicine, rheumatology and clinical immunology at the University of Florida and chairman and CEO of the Gout & Uric Acid Education Society, told Live Science.\n\nUric acid is a waste product created during the normal breakdown of purines, naturally occurring substances found in foods such as liver, mushrooms, anchovies, mackerel and dried beans according to theNIAMS.\n\nUric acid is normally cleaned out of the blood by the kidneys, and passes out of the body along with urine. However, high levels of uric acid can accumulate in the body, either when the kidneys excrete too little uric acid or when the body produces too much uric acid. This condition is known as hyperuricemia, according to the NIH.\n\nThe high concentration of uric acid in the blood will eventually convert the acid into urate crystals, which can then accumulate around the joints and soft tissues. Deposits of the needle-like urate crystals are responsible for the inflammation and the painful symptoms of gout.\n\nThere are several factors that can make a person more susceptible to gout, according to the NIH. A few are:\n\nAccording to theMayo Clinic, common symptoms of gout are:\n\nGout and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) both cause bumpy, painful joints, but they couldn't be more different.Rheumatoid arthritisis a disease in which the body's immune system attacks itself, causing damage to tissue and organs while gout has nothing to do with the immune system. \"Unfortunately, when chronic, it can involve many joints making it difficult to distinguish from rheumatoid arthritis,\" Dr. Nathan Wei, a rheumatologist and director of the Arthritis Treatment Center in Frederick, Maryland, told Live Science. \"Obviously, if the patient has a high level of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP, that helps. However, a few patients may have concomitant RA and gout.\"\n\nGout and pseudogout closely resemble each other, but they each have very different characteristics. \"The amount of pain suffered by a patient with pseudogout is usually less than is experienced by a gout patient,\" Edwards said. \"The main difference between gout and pseudogout are the types of crystals that deposit into the joints and cause inflammation.\" Edwards went on to point out that monosodium urate (MSU) crystals cause gout, while pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals.\n\nWhile gout has painful and distinctive symptoms during flare-ups, its symptoms can be vague during other times. A doctor may extract a sample of joint fluid so it can be examined under a microscope for any presence of urate crystals, according to the NIAMS.\n\nCertain joint infections can produce symptoms similar to gout. If an infection is suspected, the doctor may check joint fluid for bacteria.\n\nBlood tests can reveal the concentration of uric acid in the blood and further confirm the diagnosis. However, according to theMayo Clinic, blood tests can be misleading, because some gout patients do not have an unusual level of uric acid in their blood, and some people with high levels of uric acid do not go on to develop gout.\n\n\"A patients gout will not get better until they start taking uric-acid-lowering drugs. Patients need to know that their serum uric acid level should be below the target of 6 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). While gout cannot be cured, it can be better managed, or even controlled completely, with the right medications and lifestyle choices,\" Edwards said.\n\nIn most cases, long-term medications for lowering uric acid will be used to treat gout and prevent flares gout. \"Generally, patients with gout will need to be on these drugs for life. If they stay on them over time, their gout symptoms and risk of deformity or disability will be greatly decreased,\" Edwards added.\n\nThe painful symptoms of gout can be alleviated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can reduce both pain and inflammation around the joints, according to theUniversity of Maryland. Depending on the severity of the flare-ups, patients can be treated with over-the-counter NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve) or with prescription-strength painkillers such as indomethacin (available under the trade name Indocin).\n\nCorticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be injected directly into the affected joints for relief within a few hours, according toMayo Clinic. However, despite their effectiveness, corticosteroids must be used sparingly, because they can weaken bones or poor wound healing.\n\nAnother pain reliever commonly used to reduce gout pain is colchicine. It is most effective when taken within the first 12 hours of symptoms, according to NIAMS. Once the flare-up subsides, the doctor may prescribe low, daily doses of colchicine to ward off future attacks.\n\nBeyond medications, patients can also control the frequency of flare-ups through exercise and diet adjustments. Because uric acid is created during the digestion and breakdown of purines, patients can reduce the concentration of uric acid in the blood by avoiding high-purine foods such as anchovies, asparagus, dried beans and peas, mushrooms and organ meats (such as livers and kidneys). TheMayo Clinicalso suggests that patients should drink more water and less alcohol, because alcohol can raise the level of uric acid in the blood.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only, and is not meant to offer medical advice."}
