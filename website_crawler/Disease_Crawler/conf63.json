{"heading": "Rheumatoid Arthritis: Symptoms & Treatment", "contents": "When the immune system goes awry and attacks the joints, it results in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This disorder can cause significant pain and joint deformity by wearing away joint linings. It is a chronic, debilitating condition that has no cure, and it affects about 1.5 million people in the United States, according to the Arthritis Foundation.\n\n\"If the disease goes untreated, it can cause permanent damage to the joints. It can also cause other problems, such as inflammation in the lungs or the eyes,\" said Dr. Linda Mileti, a rheumatologist at the Cleveland Clinic. The disorder can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease as well, she added.\n\nJoint damage can happen in the first two years in which a person has the disorder, according to the Arthritis Foundation. RA usually affects joints on both sides of the body equally, starting in the small joints of the wrists, hands, ankles and feet. Though this condition is not generally known as a lethal disease, people with RA are two times more likely to die than people of the same age without RA in the general population, according to the Arthritis Foundation.\n\nThough doctors can characterize aspects of the disease, they do not know a cause. \"RA is an autoimmune disorder with genetic susceptibility, but the cause is unknown,\" Dr. N. Lawrence Edwards, a professor of medicine at the University of Florida, told Live Science. Genetic susceptibility means that environmental factors, such as viral or bacterial infection, may be more likely to lead to RA in a person, due to that individual's inherited traits, according to theMayo Clinic.\n\nOther known risk factors include gender and age. RA is two to three times more common in women than men, according to the Mayo Clinic. It most commonly begins in middle age and occurs more frequently in older people, according to theNational Institutes of Health, but RA can also affect older teenagers and young adults.\n\nAnother risk factor is smoking. Heavy, long-term smoking is a \"very strong\" risk factor for RA, according to theUniversity of Maryland Medical Center.\n\nRA symptoms can be very vague at the onset, resembling those of many otherillnesses. They also vary from patient to patient and may come and go. According to the Mayo Clinic, symptoms include:\n\nNo single test can confirm RA, sodoctorsusually rely on a variety of tests to make a diagnosis. These examinations study joint structure or measure the amount of inflammation present in the body.\n\nAccording to the Arthritis Foundation, tests include:\n\nBecause RA has no cure, treatments are usually life long and focus on relieving symptoms as well as preventing and slowing joint damage. \"Patients need to understand that RA is a multisystem disease that can attack organs such as the lungs, bone marrow, eyes and cardiovascular system,\" Dr. Nathan Wei, a rheumatologistand director of the Arthritis Treatment Center in Frederick, Maryland, told Live Science. \"Hence the need for aggressive treatment.\"\n\nMany over-the-counter andprescription drugsare available to treat RA, though some have potentially serious side effects that must be carefully monitored. Usually, patients take these medicines in combination. According to the Mayo Clinic, RA medications include:\n\nAnother major RA treatment is surgery, which is an option when drugs cannot prevent or slow joint damage. According to the NIH, surgical procedures for RA include tendon repair; total joint replacement therapy, which substitutes man-made joints for damaged ones; synovectomy, which removes theinflamed synovial tissue; and joint fusion (arthrodesis), which can stabilize joints, increase mobility and relieve pain.\n\nSelf-care can help people manage RA symptoms, the Mayo Clinic said. Light exercise, such as walking, swimming or water aerobics, can help strengthen the muscles around joints. Applying heat may help ease pain and relex muscles, while applying cold may dull the pain. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, hypnosis and guided imagery, can also help control pain."}
